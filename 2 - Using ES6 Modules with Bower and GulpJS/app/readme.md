## Space Coast JS Presentations
### Presentation 2 - ES6 Modules with Bower and GulpJS.

#### Getting Started
After you clone the code from Github, you will need to install all required dependencies. To do this, please run the following commands:

	npm install
	bower install

To build and run the demo, use the following command:

	gulp

Your browser window should open automatically. Any changes you make to the demo source code will trigger a recompile and the changes will be reflected in the browser automatically.

If you want to build the demo withour running it, use the following command:

	gulp build

To run the demo with browser-sync without performing a build, use the following command:

	gulp start
